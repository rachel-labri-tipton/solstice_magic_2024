# Winter solstice NodeJS magic 2024
This is a repo for the Women Coding Community 2024 Christmas Coding Challenge. 
Throughout the month of December, I'll be working through an online course covering NodeJS and practicing my JavaScript LeetCode Problems. Let's see how it goes? 

## Goals

- feel more confident working with Node.js 
- improve my JavaScript knowledge

## Day 1

In a bit of a rush (because I forgot the challenge started today!!!), I set up my code challenge repo and made an initial commit with a small Node.js program that generated a text file. I revisited the idea that Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. It's always hard for me to remember what runtime means. 

Essentially, Node.js is a software environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed on a server, providing a platform to run JavaScript outside of a web browser. This enables server-side development using the JavaScript language. Rather than being considered a language itself, Node.js is a runtime environment because it takes JavaScript code and executes it. Hopefully all of this will make a bit more sense by the end of the challenge. 

## Day 2 

Today in my Node.js course, I completed a small JavaScript refresher and created a basic http request server in the `app.js` file. In JavaScript, I enjoyed the review of primitive and reference types as well as object destructuring and the spread and rest operators. I also enjoyed revisiting request and response Node.js basics. It felt good to run the server and have something happen in the browser. One Node.js topic I'm interested in learning more about tomorrow is the Event Loop. 

## Day 3 

The focus today in the course I'm following was on the Event Loop that Node.js sets up to handle event callbacks. I moved the routes out of the `app.js` file and created a `routes.js` file. 

The summary of the module: 

- How the Web Works: Client => Request => Server => Response => Client
- Node.js Program Lifecycle & Event Loop: Node.js runs non-blocking JS code and uses the Event Loop for running the logic
- Asynchronous Code
- Requests and Responses => request data parsed in chunks 
- Node.js and Core Modules => Node.js ships with core modules (ex. http, fs, path...) and can be imported into any file with `require('module')`
- Node Module System => import via `require('module')` and export via `module.exports` or `exports.` for multiple exports


## Day 4 

Today I completed an assignment to spin up a server and add a couple routes.
